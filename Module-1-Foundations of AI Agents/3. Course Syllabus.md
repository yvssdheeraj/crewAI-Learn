# Course Syllabus

### What Is This Course About?

This program, designed by João Moura in partnership with DeepLearning.AI, teaches the fundamentals of building, evaluating, and deploying multi-agent AI systems.

Across four modules, you will learn how to:

- Build AI agents using core building blocks such as memory, tools (including MCP servers), guardrails, and execution hooks
- Design and orchestrate multi-agent workflows using flows and advanced coordination strategies
- Add observability, evaluation, and continuous improvement using tracing, testing, and human feedback
- Deploy, monitor, and scale agents safely in production using best practices

Hands-on labs include building systems like a deep researcher and a meeting co-pilot.
