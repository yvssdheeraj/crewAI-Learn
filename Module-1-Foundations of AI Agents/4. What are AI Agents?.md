# What Are AI Agents?

## Introduction
AI agents are becoming a major topic in modern AI systems. This lesson explains what AI agents are, how they work, and why they enable automations that were not possible before.

---

## Definition of an AI Agent
An **AI agent** is a system that can **decide what happens next in order to accomplish a goal**.

Unlike traditional chat systems, AI agents:
- Control application flow
- Make decisions autonomously
- Choose actions based on context and objectives

---

## Core Building Block: Large Language Models (LLMs)
At their core, all AI agents start with a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.

LLMs are naturally good at:
- Generating text
- Creating content
- Offering multiple alternatives

When enhanced with tools, guardrails, and controls, LLMs evolve into agents that can reason and act.

---

## From Content Generation to Decision-Making
LLMs become agentic when they:
- Compare multiple options
- Explain why one choice is better than another
- Decide steps to achieve a broader objective

This decision-making ability is referred to as **cognition**.

---

## Chat vs Agentic Systems
- **Chat systems**: Respond to prompts
- **Agentic systems**: Decide actions and control workflows

When an AI determines *what to do next* instead of just *what to say*, it becomes an agent.

---

## Why AI Agents Matter
AI agents enable:
- Advanced automations
- Flexible workflows
- Systems that adapt to changing inputs

These capabilities were difficult or impossible with traditional automation.

---

## Traditional Automation vs AI Agents

### Traditional Automation
- Built using fixed decision trees
- Requires mapping every possible path
- Fragile and hard to scale
- Breaks if an edge case is missed

### AI Agent Automation
- Decides actions dynamically
- Chooses the order of steps
- Adapts to user input in real time
- Reduces complexity and maintenance

---

## Key Capabilities of AI Agents

### Cognition
Agents choose the best next action based on context.

### Real-Time Responsiveness
Agents react dynamically to different user inputs.

### Self-Healing
If a step fails, agents can:
- Try alternative tools
- Use different APIs
- Adjust their approach automatically

### Self-Improvement
Agents learn from repeated execution:
- Reinforce successful behaviors
- Avoid ineffective strategies over time

---

## What Powers Agentic Systems
Two core abilities drive AI agents:
1. **Creation** – generating text, emails, images, or outputs
2. **Decision-Making** – choosing tools, data, actions, and recovery paths

---

## Reliability and Scalability
For AI agents to be useful in real-world systems, they must be:
- Reliable
- Trustworthy
- Easy to manage

Poor reliability can lead to failures like incorrect refunds or unresolved support issues.

---

## What’s Next
Not all use cases are created equal. And some use cases are better for agents than others. The next lesson focuses on identifying the **best use cases** where AI agents deliver the most value.
