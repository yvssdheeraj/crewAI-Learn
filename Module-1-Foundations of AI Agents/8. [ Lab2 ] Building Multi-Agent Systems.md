# 🧪 Build Multi Agent Research System
---

## 🎯 Lab Objective

This lab walks through building a **first multi-agent research system** using CrewAI. The goal is to create a reusable **deep research crew** that can gather, verify, and produce a high-quality research report on any given topic.

This crew will be iteratively improved throughout future lessons.

---

## 🤖 Multi-Agent System Overview

The system consists of **four agents**, each with a clearly defined role:

1. **Research Planner**
   - Analyzes the user query
   - Breaks it down into smaller, focused research topics
   - Produces a structured research plan

2. **Internet Researcher**
   - Executes the research plan
   - Uses web search and scraping tools
   - Collects detailed information from online sources

3. **Fact Checker**
   - Verifies claims, features, and pricing
   - Cross-checks sources for accuracy
   - Ensures reliability of gathered data

4. **Report Writer**
   - Synthesizes validated research
   - Produces a polished **Markdown report**
   - Includes summaries, tables, sources, and comparisons

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Web Search Tool**
  - Performs live internet searches
- **Website Scraping Tool**
  - Extracts detailed content from selected URLs

> Tool usage is introduced at a high level in this lesson, with deeper exploration planned for future modules.

## 🧱 Core CrewAI Concepts Applied

### 1. Agents
- Each agent has:
  - A specific role
  - A clear goal
  - A defined backstory
- Some agents (researcher, fact checker) share the same toolset

---

### 2. Tasks
- Tasks are **explicit and structured**
- Each task defines:
  - Objectives
  - Expected outputs
  - Quality constraints (e.g., comprehensive, well-sourced)

#### Variable Interpolation
- User input (the research query) is injected into tasks
- This input drives the entire workflow
- Enables dynamic reuse of the same crew for different topics

---

### 3. Sequential Execution

The crew operates **sequentially**, where each step builds on the previous one:

1. Research planning  
2. Information gathering  
3. Fact verification  
4. Report writing  

This ensures logical flow and higher reliability.

---

## 🔁 Running the Crew

- A single **user query string** is defined
- Example query:
  > *Evaluate the top five emerging AI tools for automating competitive market analysis.*

- This query is passed as input when kicking off the crew
- CrewAI automatically interpolates it into all relevant tasks and agents

---

## 👀 Observing Execution

During execution, you can observe:

- The **planner agent** creating a structured research roadmap
- The **internet researcher**:
  - Performing web searches
  - Selecting relevant sources
  - Scraping websites for deeper insights
- The **fact checker**:
  - Validating claims, features, and pricing
  - Running targeted searches for confirmation
- The **report writer**:
  - Producing a complete Markdown research report
  - Including summaries, tables, limitations, pricing, and citations

---

## 📄 Final Output

The final result is a **Markdown-formatted research report** covering:

- Top emerging AI tools
- Detailed breakdowns per tool
- Feature comparisons and limitations
- Pricing insights
- Source references

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

In future lessons, this same use case will be:

- Expanded with more advanced concepts
- Enhanced for greater reliability
- Made more complex and production-ready

➡️ The next lesson continues building on this crew.
