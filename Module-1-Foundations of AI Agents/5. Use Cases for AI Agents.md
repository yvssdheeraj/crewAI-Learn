# Use Cases for AI Agents

## Overview
This module explains how to think strategically about using AI agents by evaluating use cases based on **complexity**, **precision**, and **level of agency**. It introduces practical frameworks to help decide whether a problem should be solved with a simple LLM call, a single agent, or a full crew of agents.

## Use Case Matrix: Complexity vs Precision

A **use case** is any problem you are considering solving with AI agents.

### Dimensions
- **Complexity**: How many steps, rules, or systems are involved?
- **Precision**: How accurate and deterministic the output must be?

### Quadrants
- **High Complexity + High Precision**
  - Example: Filling out IRS forms
  - Requires correctness and deep domain knowledge
- **High Complexity + Low Precision**
  - Example: Content creation
  - Flexible structure, creativity allowed
- **Low Complexity + High Precision**
  - Simple but exact tasks
- **Low Complexity + Low Precision**
  - Often solvable with a single LLM call

**Key Insight:**  
Agents excel at high-complexity tasks, and early value is often found where precision requirements are lower.

## Spectrum of Agency

Not all use cases require the same level of autonomy.

### Levels of Agency
1. **Single LLM Call**
   - Low agency
   - LLM used as a tool
2. **Single Agent**
   - Some autonomy
   - Handles tasks independently
3. **Crew of Agents**
   - High agency
   - Specialized agents collaborate and decide execution steps

Agency increases as agents gain more control over decision-making.

## CrewAI Core Abstractions

### 1. Crews
- Designed for **high agency**
- Multiple agents with:
  - Roles
  - Memory
  - Tools
  - Tasks
- Example: Meeting preparation system using multiple specialized agents

### 2. CrewAI Flows
- Low-level orchestration framework
- Full control over execution order
- Can mix:
  - Python functions
  - Single LLM calls
  - Full crews
- Ideal when **control > autonomy**

## Flow-Based Conversational Example

### Scenario: Employee Benefits Chatbot

1. **User starts a conversation**
2. **Initial message processing**
   - Handled by a single LLM
   - Determines whether:
     - A direct answer can be given, or
     - Further analysis is required
3. **If analysis is needed**
   - A crew of agents is activated
   - Agents may:
     - Query databases
     - Access internal systems
     - Perform research and validation
4. **Final response**
   - Returned to the conversation seamlessly

This approach preserves a natural chat experience while enabling deep analysis when needed.

## Key Takeaways

- Think in terms of **ROI**, not just technical capability
- Start with **high-complexity, low-precision** problems
- Use the **minimum necessary agency**
- Combine **LLMs, agents, and crews** in structured systems
- CrewAI Flows enable precise control over complex systems

- What makes agents intelligent
- How they reason and act autonomously
