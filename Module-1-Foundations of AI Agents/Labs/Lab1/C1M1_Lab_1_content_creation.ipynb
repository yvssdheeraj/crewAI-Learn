    "# Content Creation with CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first practice lab of this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab , you'll see an example of using CrewAI for content creation. This demonstrates how to build a single-agent system for planning YouTube Shorts content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll see:**\n",
    "- How to define an agent with a specific content creation role\n",
    "- How to create a task with structured output requirements\n",
    "- How to assemble an agent and task into a crew\n",
    "- How CrewAI executes the workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this example builds:**\n",
    "A **Content Planning Agent** that creates a weekly content calendar for YouTube Shorts focusing on micro-history topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a content creator focusing on short-form video content about the surprising origins of everyday things. You want to create engaging 30-45 second YouTube Shorts that:\n",
    "- Hooks viewers in the first second\n",
    "- Tells a clear story with a surprising twist\n",
    "- Drives engagement through comments\n",
    "- Can be filmed at home with minimal equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually brainstorming and planning content, you'll use an AI agent to generate a structured weekly content plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "In this lab you will be presented with a structure of the code, but you will need to complete some of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully run this lab, replace all instances of the placeholder `None` with your own code. Sections where you need to write code will be delimited between `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`.\n",
